"GoTo" refers to a type of telescope mount and related software that can automatically point a telescope at astronomical objects that the user selects.
Both axes of a GoTo mount are driven by a motor and controlled by a computer. 
It may be either a microprocessor-based integrated controller or an external personal computer.
This differs from the single-axis semi-automated tracking of a traditional clock-drive equatorial mount.
The user can command the mount to point the telescope to the celestial coordinates that the user inputs, 
or to objects in a pre-programmed database including ones from the Messier catalogue,
the New General Catalogue, and even major Solar System bodies (the Sun, Moon, and planets).


Hardware
I used a simulation software called Proteus which allows me to simulate and hardware parts and test it before purchasing it.
Tools I need/
1-Stepper Motors type Unipolar.
2-Transistors
3-Microcontroller board (Arduino Mega)
4-Keypad
5-LCD 4*16
6-Cables

The following screenshot is all the tools that I used to simulate the project using Proteus

Software
For the software part I used C++ programing language to program the microcontroller (Arduino Mega)
Arduino is a really cool tool that allows me to control the motors, screen, and the keypad. Using programming languages.
Iâ€™m still working on the code, what I have done so far is I ask the user to choose a planet, then I took the input from the user and the motors will start working.
