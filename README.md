"GoTo" refers to a type of telescope mount and related software that can automatically point a telescope at astronomical objects that the user selects.
Both axes of a GoTo mount are driven by a motor and controlled by a computer. 
It may be either a microprocessor-based integrated controller or an external personal computer.
This differs from the single-axis semi-automated tracking of a traditional clock-drive equatorial mount.
The user can command the mount to point the telescope to the celestial coordinates that the user inputs, 
or to objects in a pre-programmed database including ones from the Messier catalogue,
the New General Catalogue, and even major Solar System bodies (the Sun, Moon, and planets).
